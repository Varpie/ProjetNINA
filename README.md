# ProjetSIDA

Coding style :

- Only C-style comments

  ```
  /* This is okay */
  // This is not okay
  ```

- Opening curly brackets don't go after if statements, they go under it.

  Do this:

  ```
  if (true)
  {   
  ```

  Don't do that:

  ```
  if (true) {
  ```

- Functions work the opposite way (curly brackets under the function name)
